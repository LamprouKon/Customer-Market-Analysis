Customer Segmentation and Pareto Analysis with RFM
ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model. By leveraging the Pareto Principle, it identifies the most valuable customers contributing significantly to total sales.

ðŸ“š Overview:
Data Preprocessing:

Filtering out invalid transactions (e.g., negative quantities or prices).
Handling missing values and outliers.
RFM Scoring:

Calculation of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for each customer.
Categorization of customers into RFM scores using quantile-based binning.
Segmentation:

Assigning customer segments based on RFM scores.
Use of regex and mappings for categorization (e.g., VIP, Top at Risk, etc.).
Pareto Analysis:

Identifying the percentage of customers contributing to 80% of total sales.
Validating the Pareto Principle with graphical insights.
Visualization:

Creating detailed bar and Pareto charts for customer segmentation and sales contribution analysis.

ðŸš€ Key Features:
Dynamic RFM Scoring: Calculates scores and categorizes customers dynamically based on quantiles.
Pareto Validation: Confirms the 80/20 rule for customer contribution using cumulative percentage plots.
Segmentation Insights: Provides actionable labels for customer segments to guide marketing strategies.
Interactive Visualizations: Engaging and professional charts to display results effectively.
